# Java Calculator

## **Description**

This Java program implements a **menu-driven calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations using Object-Oriented Programming concepts. Each operation is encapsulated in its own class, promoting clean structure and maintainability. The program demonstrates modular design by separating each mathematical function into dedicated classes.

## **Features**

1.  Implements **object-oriented design** for each mathematical operation.
2.  Supports operations like:
   - Addition  
   - Subtraction  
   - Multiplication  
   - Division  
   - Square  
   - Square Root  
   - Cube  
3. Uses **individual classes** for each operation to ensure clean separation of logic.
4. Handles **exception cases** like:
   - Division by zero  
   - Square root of a negative number  
5.  Offers a **loop-based menu system** that runs until the user chooses to exit.

## **Usage**

1. The program starts with a menu displaying all available operations.
2. User selects an operation using numeric input.
3. Based on the operation:
   - Program accepts one or two numbers as input.
   - Executes the corresponding class method.
   - Displays the result.
4. Program continues running until the user selects **Exit** from the menu.
